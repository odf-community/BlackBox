    4a. Usage: ./blackbox.sh [--version] [--repo] [--progctrl] 

    4b. Usage Requirements!

        4b-1. The [--repo] Argument Must Have A Function Culprit
              As Well As A Repository Variable.
              
              Ex: ./blackbox.sh --repo import odfsec

        4b-4. Required Dependencies: bash, wget, unzip

        4b-5. Required Elements: Terminal Emulator (X-term or Gnome-Terminal etc.)

    4c. Repo 'import' Function

        4c-1. ./blackbox.sh --repo import

        4c-2. This Command Downloads The Repository Variable's DL-AGENT.
              The DL-AGENT Script is Defined @ repo/'repo_name'/dl.info.

        4c-3. After Downloading The Database Package Defined Within The
              DL-AGENT File, The Contents In 'database-remote' Will Be
              Copied To The Local Repository Area.

        4c-4. If An Update To The Database File Occurs After Downloading,
              Re-Execution Of The 'import' Function Will Rebuild The Local
              Database Area.

    4d. Repo 'create' Function

        4d-1. ./blackbox.sh --repo create

        4d-2. This Command Creates A New Local DL-AGENT Based On An Internally
              Defined File Template. It Is Not Required To Use This Template,
              As Long As The Database Package That Is Downloaded Is Placed
              In The '/tmp/BBDigital_TMP' Directory.

        4d-3. This Argument Accepts {installcanidate} Variables.
              The Only Accepted {installcanidate} Variable For This
              Argument Would Be 'localdb'. Using This Install Canidate
              Will Also Generate a Local Database That Can Be Published
              With A Supplicant You Create Yourself.

              This Is Only Used In Necessity To Creating A New Remote Repository
              Ex: ./blackbox.sh --repo create 'new_repo_name' localdb

        4d-4. All Produced Repositories Will Be Placed In 'repo/' Of The "$PWD"

    4e. Repo 'delete' Function

        4e-1. ./blackbox.sh --repo delete

        4e-2. This Command Deletes Local Repositories OR 'database-remote' Data.

        4e-3. This Argument Accepts {installcanidate} Variables.
              The Only Accepted {installcanidate} Variable For This
              Argument Would Be 'remote'. Using This Install Canidate
              Will Select The Repositories 'database-remote' Data
              For Removal.

              Ex: ./blackbox.sh --repo delete 'my_repo' remote

    4f. Repo 'install' Function

        4f-1. ./blackbox.sh --repo install

        4f-2. This Command Installs Packages Derived From The Repository Database.

        4f-3. Use This In Conjunction With The Install Agents Listed In The Database Listing
              This Is The Main Purpose Of BlackBox. After Downloading And Extracting The
              Database Remote Data, The Script Will Search For The Correspoding Install
              Canidate For The Install Agent Requested In Your Command.

              A Successfull Install Command Should Look Like This:

              ./blackbox.sh --repo install 'repo_name' 'install_agent'

        4f-4. After The Command Is Run, It Will Execute The BBDigital Setup Script
              For The Desired Program/Script. This Will Download All Dependencies
              And Files For The Tool And Place Them Where Necessary.

              Some Tools Are Individual Binaries, And Some Come In GitHub Repo's
              Or From 3rd Party Sources. Please Note That All Code Is Reviewed Before
              Being Placed Within Our Public Repo.
